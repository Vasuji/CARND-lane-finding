**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report


### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function and added the property of 

My pipeline consisted of following steps. 


#### Step-I:

First, I converted the images to grayscale, using  ```grayscale``` helper function. The output image is green because it choose single color. In order to get it as grey we must set it as ```plt.imshow(gray_image, cmap='gray')```.

```
grey_image = grayscale(image)

```

#### Step-II:

In second Step, I added the property of gaussian blur to the image. Eventhough it was optional step because ```Canny``` function is going to use ```5 x 5``` kernel size for adding gaussian noise, I added this to see it's effect.

```
gaussian_blur_image = gaussian_blur(grey_image, kernel_size=3)

```

#### Step-III:

In third step, I applied canny helper function to find sharp edges. Sharp edges are because of change in pixcel values which we call gradient.
```
 canny_image = canny(gaussian_blur_image,\
                    low_threshold=50,\
                    high_threshold=150)
 ```

#### Step-IV:

In fourth step, I selected the region of interest. For this we nne to set vertices as :
```
vertices0 = np.array([[(0,imshape[0]),\
                      (450, 320),\
                      (500, 320),\
                      (imshape[1],imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)
```
Using these verticies we can get masked image by using ```region_of_interest``` helper function.

```
 masked_image = region_of_interest(canny_image,\
                                  vertices=vertices0 )
```

#### Step-V:

In step V, I used ```houg_line``` helper function. The most important code in this section is ```draw_lines``` function

```
 line_image = hough_lines(masked_image, rho =2, \
                          theta=np.pi/180,\
                          threshold=20, \
                          min_line_len=25,\
                          max_line_gap =10)
```

Here are few sub-steps for ```draw_line``` helper function

  * Set minimum slope threshold and avoid infinite slope in maximum slope threshold
  
  * Seperate allowed lines detected by function ```cv2.HoughLinesP``` into two families right_lines and left_lines
  
  * Use linear regression function ```interpolation``` to ge 'm' and 'b' value for a line'y=mx+b' for each line(right and left)
  * Use the value of 'm' and 'b' to draw lines finding end point (use```end_pint_finder```) of line in the image.

#### Step-VI:

In step IV, I used ```weighted_image``` which blends line image over intial image with given parameters ```α , β and λ```

```

weighted_image = weighted_img(line_image, initial_img,
                           α=0.8,\
                           β=1.,\
                           λ=0.)
```
