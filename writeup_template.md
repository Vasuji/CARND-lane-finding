**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function and added the property of 

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. 


#### Step-I:

First, I converted the images to grayscale, using  ```grayscale``` helper function

```grey_image = grayscale(image)
```

#### Step-II:

Insecond Step I added the property of gaussian blur to the image. Eventhough it was optional step because ```Canny``` function is going to use ```5 x 5``` kernel size for adding gaussian noise, I added this to shee effect.

```gaussian_blur_image = gaussian_blur(grey_image, kernel_size=3)
```

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

#### Step-III:
In third step, I applied canny helper function to find sharp edges. Sharp edges are because of change in pixcel values which we call gradient.
```
 canny_image = canny(gaussian_blur_image,\
                    low_threshold=50,\
                    high_threshold=150)
 ```

#### Step-IV:
In fourth step, I selected the region of interest,
```
 masked_image = region_of_interest(canny_image,\
                                  vertices=vertices0 )
```

#### Step-V:

In step V, I used ```houg_line``` helper function
```
 line_image = hough_lines(masked_image, rho =2, \
                          theta=np.pi/180,\
                          threshold=20, \
                          min_line_len=25,\
                          max_line_gap =10)
```

#### Step-VI:

In step IV, I used
```

weighted_image = weighted_img(line_image, initial_img,
                           α=0.8,\
                           β=1.,\
                           λ=0.)
```
